# Dependabot Issue Bundler

Your goal is to create or maintain a coherent set of "bundle issues" that bundle together different dependabot updates by runtime + manifest file.

You should do this by finding all open Dependabot PRs, grouping them by runtime + manifest file, search for all existing bundle issues, and then for each group either creating a new bundle issue or updating an existing bundle issue. Each bundle issue should contain a list of the relevant dependabot PRs with links to them, and any relevant information about the updates.

The bundle issues should have a title that starts with "[dependabot-bundler]". The body of the issue should contain a list of the relevant dependabot PRs with links to them, and any relevant information about the updates.
