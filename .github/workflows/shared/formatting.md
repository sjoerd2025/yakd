## Content Structure

Structure your output with an overview followed by detailed content:

1. **Content Overview**: Start with 1-2 paragraphs that summarize the key findings, highlights, or main points of your report. This should give readers a quick understanding of what the report contains without needing to expand the details.

2. **Detailed Content**: Place the rest of your report inside HTML `<details>` and `<summary>` tags to allow readers to expand and view the full information. **IMPORTANT**: Always wrap the summary text in `<b>` tags to make it bold.

**Example format:**

`````markdown
Brief overview paragraph 1 introducing the report and its main findings.

Optional overview paragraph 2 with additional context or highlights.

<details>
<summary><b>Full Report Details</b></summary>

## Footer Attribution
